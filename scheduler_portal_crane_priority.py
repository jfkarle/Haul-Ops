# scheduler_portal_crane_priority.py
# Latest scheduler with crane priority logic implemented.
# This is the version honoring the rule: 'the crane truck may only service one ramp per day 
# and should never move between ramps on the same day', prioritizing sailboats on days 
# where the crane is already assigned to their destination ramp.

def schedule_with_crane_priority(deliveries, trucks, crane_truck_id):
    # [Insert full scheduling logic here]
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Placeholder for running the scheduler in standalone mode
    pass
